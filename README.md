# AlexNet CNN for Image Classification

This project implements the AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify images from a dataset of three categories: pizza, steak, and sushi. The project demonstrates how AlexNet can be adapted for small-scale datasets while maintaining its deep learning architecture principles.
